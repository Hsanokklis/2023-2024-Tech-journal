Team members: Hannelore, Savannah, Lily, Adra

Goal: Write a Python program that will convert any number, regarless of its base
to its base-10, binary or hexadecmimal equivalent

Assumptions: When possible, Python user-defined functiuons control the flow and
execution of the code

The options include:
A: Binary to Hexadecmial
B: Binary to Base-10
C: Hexadecimal to Base-10
D: Hexadecimal to Binary
E: Base-10 to Binary
F: Base-10 to Hexadecimal

Steps:
1. Provide conversion options to the user
2. User inputs choice of conversation option
3. Provide input for the value
4. User enters an appropriate value
5. Print resul
6. stop
